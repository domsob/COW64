o         super();
o     }
o  
o      public String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {
-          return " title=\"" + toolTipText
-              + "\" alt=\"\"";

Condition: The change was necessary to escape special characters in the toolTipText before generating the tool tip fragment.

Consequence: The potential impact of this change is that any special characters in the toolTipText will be properly escaped, ensuring that the generated tool tip fragment is valid HTML.

Position: The change was implemented in the `generateToolTipFragment` method of the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator` class.

Cause: The previous implementation did not escape special characters in the toolTipText, which could cause issues if the text contained characters that are interpreted as HTML entities. This could result in invalid HTML or potential security vulnerabilities.

Change: The code was modified to call the `htmlEscape` method from the `ImageMapUtilities` class to escape any special characters in the toolTipText before generating the tool tip fragment. This ensures that the generated tool tip fragment will be valid HTML.
