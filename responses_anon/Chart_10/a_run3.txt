Condition: The change was necessary when generating a tooltip fragment for an image map.

Consequence: The potential impact of this change is that the tooltip text will be properly escaped using the `ImageMapUtilities.htmlEscape()` method. This ensures that any special characters in the tooltip text are correctly encoded for HTML.

Position: The change was implemented in the `generateToolTipFragment()` method of the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator` class.

Cause: The motivation for this change is to address the problem of unescaped special characters in the tooltip text. The previous implementation did not account for special characters, which could lead to invalid HTML or potential security issues.

Change: The code was altered to use the `ImageMapUtilities.htmlEscape()` method to properly escape the tooltip text before generating the tooltip fragment. This ensures that any special characters are encoded correctly for HTML.
