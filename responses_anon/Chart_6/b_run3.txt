Condition: The change was necessary to improve the implementation of the equals() method in the ShapeList class.

Consequence: The potential impact of this change is that the equals() method will now compare each shape in the ShapeList with the corresponding shape in the other ShapeList, using the ShapeUtilities.equal() method. This will ensure that the shapes are compared correctly for equality.

Position: The change was implemented in the equals() method of the ShapeList class.

Cause: The previous implementation of the equals() method in the ShapeList class did not compare the shapes correctly for equality. It used the super.equals() method, which did not take into account the shapes in the list.

Change: The code was altered to iterate through each shape in the ShapeList and compare it with the corresponding shape in the other ShapeList using the ShapeUtilities.equal() method. If any shapes are not equal, the method returns false. If all shapes are equal, the method returns true. This ensures that the shapes in the list are properly compared for equality.
