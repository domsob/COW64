Change: The code has been modified in the generateToolTipFragment() method.

Condition: The change was necessary to properly escape special characters in the toolTipText before generating the tooltip fragment.

Consequence: The potential impact of this change is that the toolTipText will now be properly escaped, ensuring that any special characters are not interpreted as HTML code, which could potentially cause issues or security vulnerabilities.

Position: The change was implemented in the generateToolTipFragment() method of the StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator class.

Cause: The motivation for this change was to address the issue of special characters in the toolTipText. The previous implementation did not escape these characters, which could lead to incorrect rendering of the tooltip or potential security vulnerabilities if the toolTipText contained malicious code.

Change: The code was altered to use the ImageMapUtilities.htmlEscape() method to properly escape the toolTipText before generating the tooltip fragment. This ensures that any special characters are properly handled and displayed correctly in the tooltip. The "title" attribute of the tooltip now includes the escaped toolTipText.
