Condition: The change was necessary when generating a tooltip fragment for an image map.

Consequence: The potential impact of this change is that the toolTipText parameter is now HTML escaped using the ImageMapUtilities.htmlEscape() method before being used in the tooltip fragment. This helps prevent any potential issues with special characters or HTML tags in the toolTipText.

Position: The change was implemented in the generateToolTipFragment() method of the StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator class.

Cause: The motivation for this change was to ensure that the toolTipText parameter is properly escaped to prevent any potential issues with special characters or HTML tags that could affect the rendering of the tooltip.

Change: The code was altered to use the ImageMapUtilities.htmlEscape() method to escape the toolTipText parameter before using it in the tooltip fragment. This ensures that any special characters or HTML tags are correctly handled in the tooltip.
