# RESPONSE ####################################

Condition: The change was necessary when generating a tooltip tag fragment in the StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator class.

Consequence: The potential impact of this change is that the toolTipText is now HTML-escaped using ImageMapUtilities.htmlEscape before being included in the tooltip tag fragment. This ensures that any special characters in the toolTipText are properly encoded in the HTML.

Position: The change was implemented in the generateToolTipFragment() method of the StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator class.

Cause: The motivation for this change was to address the problem of potential special characters in the toolTipText. Without HTML-escaping the toolTipText, special characters could disrupt the HTML structure or introduce security vulnerabilities.

Change: The code was altered to include an HTML-escaped version of the toolTipText by calling ImageMapUtilities.htmlEscape() on the toolTipText before generating the tooltip tag fragment. This ensures that the toolTipText is properly encoded and can be safely used in the HTML output.
