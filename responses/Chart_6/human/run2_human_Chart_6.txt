Condition: The change was necessary in order to properly implement the equals() method for the ShapeList class.

Consequence: The change ensures that the equals() method correctly compares ShapeList objects by comparing the shapes in the list.

Position: The change was implemented within the equals() method of the ShapeList class.

Cause: The previous implementation of the equals() method did not correctly compare ShapeList objects. It relied on the superclass implementation of equals(), which may not have been sufficient for comparing ShapeList objects.

Change: The code was modified to iterate through the shapes in the ShapeList and compare them using the ShapeUtilities.equal() method. This ensures that the shapes are properly compared when determining equality.
