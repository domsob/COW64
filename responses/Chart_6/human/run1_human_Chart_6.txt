Condition: The change was necessary when comparing two ShapeList objects for equality.

Consequence: The change ensures that the equality check considers the shapes within the ShapeList objects.

Position: The change was made in the equals(Object obj) method of the ShapeList class.

Cause: The previous implementation of the equals(Object obj) method did not consider the shapes within the ShapeList objects, resulting in incorrect equality comparisons.

Change: The code was modified to iterate over each shape in the ShapeList and compare it with the corresponding shape in the other ShapeList. If any pair of shapes are not equal, the method returns false. If all shapes are equal, the method returns true. This ensures that the equality check takes into account the shapes within the ShapeList objects.
